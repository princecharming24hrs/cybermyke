## Catnork â€“ Designing a Secure Internal Network for Improved Operational Efficiency 

### **Business Focus -**
Network Design & Security
### **End nodes or Hardware components required-** 
- Cisco Router 2811
- CAT 6 cables
- 2 Cisco Switches for HR Dept & IT Dept
- 1 DNS Server 
- 1 DHCP Server
- 1 Web Server
- Laptops and computers for the staff 


### SETTING A NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE
### ** Network Connection** 
- Position all hardware components appropriately consideration safety and high availability and functionality 
- Servers in designated server room
- Switches in the appropriated position for each office / department that will enhance ease of cabling and connection for laptop and computers for staff
- run network connection to all hardware components

### ** Network Configuration** 
Static IP Addresses will be assigned to all devices as follows 

- CISCO ROUTER 
- DHCP SERVER 
- DNS SERVER 
- WEB SERVER
of course network switches don't need ip addresses as 

- description - SITUATION
  A law firm wanted to resolve slow internet service and manage slow service for all its staff

- EXPERIENCE
  All the staff were experiencing slow internet service, their computers were having issues with connection to the office network, they also needed to have a setup where some departments can share documents and printer among them, they also wanted their web server to have some level of limitation on who can work on it 

- APPROACH
  Step 1 Setup the Router with different ip routers for different departments 
  step 2 setup a DHCP server that will access ip addresses and also setup different ip segments for different departments
  setp 3 setup a web server  
  setup access list for web server
